## Attributions

We used the following datasets in this project:

### Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
We obtained the terrorism data from Kaggle:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)

> The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database that provides detailed information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 through 2017. It includes over 180,000 domestic and international incidents. The GTD is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland.

### Country Population Data
To normalize the number of attacks per country, we created a custom population dataset derived from World Bank data:
[https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

> Please note: our population dataset is static and intended only for this project. It will not be updated or maintained.
